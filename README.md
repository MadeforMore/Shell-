## üìù AutoBackup.sh

### Description

`AutoBackup.sh` copies all files from a **source folder** to a **backup folder**. Each run updates the backup with the latest files.

### Script

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# ============================================================
# üìÇ Folder Backup Script
#
# This script allows you to take a backup of a folder
# from your system into a specified backup directory.
# ============================================================

# Source folder (the folder you want to backup)
SOURCE="/home/yourusername/Documents"

# Backup folder (where the backup will be stored)
BACKUP="/home/username/backup"

# Create backup directory if not present
mkdir -p "$BACKUP"

# Copy files from source to backup folder
cp -r "$SOURCE"/* "$BACKUP"

echo "‚úÖ Backup completed successfully from $SOURCE to $BACKUP"
```

### Steps to Use

1. **Create working directory**

```bash
mkdir test && cd test
```

2. **Create the script file**

```bash
touch backup.sh
```

3. **Open the file in an editor** (vim, nano, etc.) and paste the script above
4. **Make it executable**

```bash
chmod +x backup.sh
```

5. **Run the script**

```bash
./backup.sh
```

### Notes

* Replace the paths in the script:

```bash
SOURCE="/home/yourusername/Documents"  # Folder to backup
BACKUP="/home/username/backup"         # Backup destination
```

* Backup directory will be created if it does not exist.
* Existing files in the backup folder will be overwritten.

### Example Output

```bash
‚úÖ Backup completed successfully from /home/yourusername/Documents to /home/username/backup
```

If you want, I can also make a **version with collapsible code sections** for a cleaner GitHub look so the script doesn‚Äôt take up too much space visually.  

Do you want me to do that?
